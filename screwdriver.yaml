    # Steps is the ordered list of commands to execute.
    # Each step takes the form "step_name: command_to_run". The "step_name" is a
    # convient label to reference it by. The "command_to_run" is the single 
    # command that is executed during the step.

      # Our "bundle_install" step is first in the list. It installs your Gem

      # Rakefile
